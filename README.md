# dockerized-idp-testbed

Used to validate the following Unicon docker images:

- shibboleth-idp: [https://hub.docker.com/r/unicon/shibboleth-idp](https://github.com/Unicon/shibboleth-idp-dockerized).
- shibboleth-sp: [https://hub.docker.com/r/unicon/shibboleth-sp](https://github.com/Unicon/shibboleth-sp-dockerized).
- simplesamlphp: [https://hub.docker.com/r/unicon/simplesamlphp](https://github.com/Unicon/simplesamlphp-dockerized>).

More documentation is forthcoming, but it's a full working IDP, SP, and LDAP server that runs under `docker-compose`. 

1. Update the `idp/Dockerfile` with the version of the base image you want to test.
2. Call `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up` (or `docker-compose up -d` to run as a daemon).
3. Browse to `https://idptestbed/` (after setting up an `etc/hosts` file entry pointing to your Docker Host IP), and you can login with `staff1` and `password`.  
4. `ctrl+c` then `docker-compose rm` cleans everything up to try again.

## Prepping for the Test

If testing the Shibboleth IdP build process locally, you'll want to make sure to `docker pull centos:centos7` to ensure that you have the latest before building the IdP. This will ensure that your version will match what Docker Hub will use when it builds. 

Build the IdP with `docker build --tag="unicon/shibboleth-idp:<version>" .`. Make sure the `FROM` entry in testbed's `idp/Dockerfile` matches the tag used in the idp build  or Docker Compose will pull the wrong version when running the Testbed (see step #1).

If testing the SimpleSAMLphp build process locally, you'll want to make sure to `docker pull centos:centos7` to ensure that you have the latest before building the image. This will ensure that your version will match what Docker Hub will use when it builds. 

Build the application with `docker build --tag="unicon/simplesamlphp:<version>" .`. Make sure the `FROM` entry in testbed's `simplesamlphp/Dockerfile` matches the tag used in the ssp build or Docker Compose will pull the wrong version when running the Testbed (see step #1).

## HTTP/2 support for Shibboleth IdP

HTTP/2 support can be added to Jetty by doing the following:

1. Adding the following to the `idp-http2/Dockerfile`:
 
```bash
RUN cd /opt/shib-jetty-base \
    && /opt/jre-home/bin/java -jar ../jetty-home/start.jar --add-to-startd=http2 -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.start.ack.licenses=true
ADD shib-jetty-base/alpn.ini /opt/shib-jetty-base/start.d/
```

> This will automatically accept the GPLv2 license used by the APLN library utilized by Jetty.

2. Create and populate `idp-http2/shib-jetty-base/alpn.ini`:

```apache
# ---------------------------------------
# Module: alpn
--module=alpn

## Overrides the order protocols are chosen by the server.
## The default order is that specified by the order of the
## modules declared in start.ini.
# jetty.alpn.protocols=h2-16,http/1.1

## Specifies what protocol to use when negotiation fails.
jetty.alpn.defaultProtocol=http/1.1

## ALPN debug logging on System.err
# jetty.alpn.debug=false
```

3. Run the container(s): `docker-compose -f docker-compose-http2.yml build && docker-compose -f docker-compose-http2.yml up`.

4. Test:

- Open the browser network analyzer tools. 
- Ensure that the `protocol` type is shown. 1.
- Browse to `https://idptestbed/idp/`. Chrome, firefox, and safari should show a protocol of "h2".
- Try `curl -k -v https://idptestbed/idp/`. "HTTP/1.1" will likely be shown as curl (at least on OS X) does not have http/2 support.
